# record.sh — run one command, show it on screen, and append the command AND its real output to a
# transcript file. Every demo in this repo captures its evidence this way, so the outputs quoted in
# the READMEs are never retyped from memory or reconstructed from documentation.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/record.sh <transcript-file> <command> [args...]
#
# Example:
#   scripts/record.sh demos/03-kube-proxy-free/output/transcript.txt \
#     kubectl --context kind-poc1 -n kube-system get daemonset
#
# Notes for readers:
#   - stderr is folded into stdout on purpose: a demo's failure output is evidence too, and the
#     whole point of these transcripts is that the failures are kept, not tidied away.
#   - the exit code is recorded when it is non-zero, because several demos here PROVE something by
#     failing (a curl that times out is how an L3 policy denial looks).
#   - a UTC timestamp is written per command so a transcript can be lined up against `hubble observe`
#     output, which is timestamped in the same way.
#   - RECORD_STRICT=1 (opt-in): after tee, exit with the wrapped command's rc so a `set -e`
#     caller (apply.sh) fails on a failed wait. The default stays 0 — demos prove things by
#     failing, so record.sh must not abort a set -e caller unless asked.
